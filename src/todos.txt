"""# HW: 16th may 2020
1. Fix bugs:
  a. add word indices in the input of logistic regression model
  b. remove empty clause in emotion_cause_pair_per_doc_id/
2. Vocab size is only 1000. May need to increase this to improve the accuracy
3. Create pipeline to prepare data + model training & feeding
4. Precision/recall/f1 score:
proposed_pairs = (number of correct pairs / number of proposed pairs)  ---> coming out of logistic regression model
5. Use pretrained embeddings like GloVe
